Followed a YouTube tutorial to create a full-stack mobile application using React-Native. 

Learned how to utilize React-Native, NativeWindCSS, Ecpo-Go, AppWrite, and write in JavaScript. 
Features:
Front End:
- Welcome/Starting Page

Back End:
- User registering and logging in | implemented sessions
  - User stays logged in if their session continues, sign out logs user out of session
- Databases through AppWrite:
  - User: stores user information
  - Videos: stores the video and it's information
  - One To Many relationship: The user has many videos but a video only has one user
- Upload videos, pictures, and text from a page to the database
